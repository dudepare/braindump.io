Hi! I am **Andrew Artajos**.

I am a software developer based in Sunny Melbourne, Australia.

This is my personal blog. A notebook on my laptop. I want to keep it simple. Just a collection of thoughts that transpired during the day.

*The illustration above is made by my daughter Lara. Everybody, I want to introduce you to Mr. Sun.*
