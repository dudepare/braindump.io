Today was a mix of highs and lows.

# High
I woke up early to send off dude. I finished packing away the children's clothes but not our clothes. I successfully dropped off Erin to her school with the kids in tow. All three of them. I'm happy we were not late at all. We're even early.

# Higher
I started off my homework very early too. At first I was not able to figure it out. I took breaks in between when I can't push further. When I researched a bit, I move a step closer. Then one by one--it unfolded and I was able to achieve what I set out to do. There were some drawbacks at first. Things I didn't know how todo. Things I was doing wrong. Things I should be using instead. Thank you djangobook again for saving my ass. Stack Overflow and a little bit of reading comprehension skills did the job.

Before we pick up ate Erin I submitted already a pull request to the main branch.

# Low
I decided to mindlessly update my iOS in my phone. Now, I turned my iPhone into a very thick and unconvenient iPod. I can't make or receive calls. The money I put in for the X-sim I bought back in the Philippines I threw it all away because of a mindless act. I hate it. Now I feel a little bit powerless without the power of receiving a call or sending a simple text message.

# Rise
We picked up dude and I told her all about my stupid deed. What a relief. Sometimes you just have to let it out and let somebody know. Well, it made me feel better but it didn't solve the problem. Atleast I have a temporary solution: bring with me the pocket wifi device every where I go so I could be contacted still.

# Like
I went to K-mart to have some pictures printed out for Erin's school project: Charlie's notebook. I printed out great quality pictures for a very cheap price. I want to print pictures more often. It will look nice when I have a collection of nice pictures of my kids and what ever I like. So my new motto will be keep snapping. Keep printing @ KMART. It's dirt cheap. I want to make an album out of this experience as well.

Document our stay and lives here in Australia.

# Gevey
I ordered a Gevey Sim for my bricked iPhone 4S. I don't when will it come to my doorstep but atleast I already have a solution. I need to buy a cheap mobile phone for the time being. Buy a lebara SIM. I don't care if it is a second hand phone. It just have to be a cheap one. I can't roam around the streets of Melbourne without a mobile phone. It's all the weapon I have.

# Pushups
I was able to go back to pushups today too. So happy about that. So simple but powerful.

# Blog
I also thought about the blog I left in the IBM laptop. It was in wordpress. Now, I'm using plain text Jekyll. It is a TODO for me to migrate all the entries I posted there to this one. My new and hopefully permanent Jekyll blog. I want to make it simple. Keep it in text format and version controlled. TODO upload this one too in github.

*Overall I'm still psyched about the fact that I finished my homework today. Forget what happened to my phone. Atleast, it will give me timeoff from that big distraction.*
