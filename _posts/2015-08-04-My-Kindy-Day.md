This is Lara's first day at kindy. Yeah it will be busy.

# Morning
The morning will be chaotic. We shall prepare two kids to school instead of one. I anticipate that we will go smooth for tomorrow. I'm not sure on Friday though.

We shall leave house by 8AM. Then be at Carranballac by 8:30 AM. Good luck with the breakfast.

**Which reminds me--we shall enroll Lara in Caranballac this month. It is a must!**

# Peace and Quiet

With two less kids, we will be left with Vera. We will have time for sexxxiness. I shall allot time to answer an email from a job opportunity. I will be awesome. I shall get the job this time.

Just do the first step. Send out the application--let see what happens.

# Cleanup
There is such a thing called spring cleaning. I can't wait till spring. I want to clean up the playroom tomorrow and discard some stuff. There are a ton of stuff waiting to be discarded there. We have to dig in and actually remove them from that room.

**These are a few of my favorite things... waiting to be done tomorrow.**
