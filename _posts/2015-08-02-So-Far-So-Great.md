Sunday is family day.

Today I had a productive and meaningful day. Very early in the morning I went on to the laundromat to have our clothes dried. It was a very beautiful and sunny day. The session was quick and painless. I enjoyed it while listening to podcasts. 

I love podcasts.

# Church
When I got back--we had breakfast. Then off to church. We were not that late. At church I learned to obey and trust god. Knowing that he has a plan for me too. I just have to give my trust to him. I just have to do what I have to do now. Be great at it. Follow my heart and passions. That's what I'm doing. I am discovering myself by doing what I am called to do.

# Altona Beach
After church we got back home. We went picked up the stuff that we are not using here. Then we were off to Salvos. We gave away the things. We went to Spotlight to buy stuff for our kindy--Lara. She was so happy to get things for her school. Very happy with that. Then we went to buy food at the Wrap it store. My favorite chicken wrap then off to Altona for some good old fish and chips in the park. It was very cold in the beach front but the kids had a grand time. When we got back, we also had a restful afternoon.

I also bought some very expensive brownies that is all worth it. I love that brownies so much. I bought two.

# Dinner
I finished folding our clothes tonight. Tomorrow after we drop off Erin, I shall finish the task by putting all the clothes in the cabinets. What a relief.
# Tomorrow
High in the list will be my Django assignment.

1. Finish Django assignment. Learn about querying for a specific client. Then show its details. Get list of clients. For every client in the list--get the details. Fairly easy. Create a pull request.

2. Pushups. Very basic exercise. All i need is to do it.

3. Shortlist jobs I want. Seek. Indeed. Linked in. Review those and adjust my Linked in Profile and Resume accordingly.

That's it! Of course writing will be there like I'm doing now.
