Finally Unilimited Broadband Internet is upon us. Thank you Jesus! I can contribute to open source projects without any hesitation this time.

I am so happy. Let's make awesome things. Let's make it handsome.

# Github
Work is mainly on github but I think I want to concentrate on Mozilla projects which include Django.

# Mozilla DXR / Bedrock
These are the projects I am targeting to get exposure on web development on a large scale project. This will earn me a badge with the local community here.
