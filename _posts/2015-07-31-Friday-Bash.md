Here's some of the few things I have in my head today.

# Air traffic controller requirement

I have all the requirements to lodge the Educational requirement. All I have to do are:

* scan the remaining document -- done 
* send out the application form together with all the requirements -- go to the australian post and send this one. -- done
* wait for their reply.

That's it. Then I shall start: 

* filling out the application form for the air traffic controller position. 
* attach visa requirement
* attach educational requirement
* send out my application form.

# Django

At least begin my Django homework for today. 

# What more

What else do I want to do today to make this day successful?
I think I could finally finish my dash tutorial today.
Then browse some job openings.

# DXR
I could try DXR Mozilla again. I did it! Mozilla DXR is working on my machine. What a relief!
