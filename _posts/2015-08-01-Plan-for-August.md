This is a detailed plan for this month of August. My desired outcomes and how will I achieve it.

# MelbDjango class
Thursdays till weekends. I will be occuppied for the whole month of August with this journey. I started this last month. The last meeting will be on the first week of September. In between these time is the month of August. As usual I shall get up, dress up, show up and never give up with Django and Common Code.

Little by little I gain knowledge how to move my way through bigger projects such as Mozilla's DXR. I am growing more comfortable publishing code in pulic through github and contributing to a public repository. Which is very good. I am also documenting my journey along the way. So far so good. I am on track with this.

The goal here is to meet people. Get acquainted with the norms in the development world in Melbourne. To prepare myself for a job that requires Python and Django developers.

# Air traffic controller application
Right now I just sent out my application to recognize my credentials. When that comes back from the government body that does that, I shall continue lodging my application for the position itself. 

Deadline: September 2015

# DXR Mozilla
Monday to Wednesday nights. I work on Django on Thursdays till weekends. I have the rest of the weeknights for open source project. I pick Mozilla's DXR. I've been scouting for a formidable project to contribute to and I pick this one. I hope to get a pull request out as soon as I can. It is important to merge this pull request back to the source.

The goal here is to have a viewable evidence of my work when I apply to a position. I can reference my work in here so that I can convince them that I can do their shit. 

# Fitness 
Mornings after a bath. 

This is quiet time for Dragon Boating. I shall ready myself to enroll on the first week of September though and begin serious training. Instead, I can go back to 100 pushups and start with week 2. There I can build strength. Do this until I finish the program. Continue this for life!

# Job hunt activities
One session in the morning for shortlisting jobs.
One session in the evening for sending out applications.
Allow 2 pomodoros of time to apply for a job. That is 50 minutes broken into two sessions of job hunting activities just to find that job. I shall concentrate on Web development in Django because that is what I am learning right now. Resume, Linked In, Seek, Indeed, Email, Call everything in my power to find a job in tech.

# Writing / Blogging
Every night before sleeping. 
One pomodoro will do just fine.

I shall write for myself no big deal. This should not be an issue because it will be too easy. 

Tool: Jekyll blog.
