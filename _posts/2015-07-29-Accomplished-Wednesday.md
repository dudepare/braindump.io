Some of the things I like to accomplish tonight.

# Lodge my request for Tertiary Qualification
I already have all the requirements for submission. I just have to fill in the form.

This marks the start of my serious application for the air traffic controller program.

# Read up and Accomplish remaining task for MelbDjango
Database migrations. How do I keep existing data in our model? That's the question I have to answer. Using this [Reference Doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/migrations/)

To be honest these tasks would be more than enough for the night. But if given more chance, I'd still want to write a blog post for my dudepare.github.io blog. -- done

I shall find out the right answer today.

# Books
I reduced my books down to the Javascript book. I guess I have to begin looking at contributing again to opensource now that I have a reliable internet connection.

When shall I start my javascript book? Finish my [dash tutorial](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects) first. That's a lot of things already!!!

I can stop now.
