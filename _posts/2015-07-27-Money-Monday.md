Today is Money Monday. All things money. 

# Rent & Net
I shall start off by preparing to pay rent. I usually pay rent at the end of the month. Now, I am looking forward to the month of August because this month will be the month where we will have internet.

We'll pay for that too. I think when slide the money. They will be obligated to give us the wifi password. Finally we'll have unlimited broadband connection! Yoo hoow!

Do this on Friday 31 July 2015

# Melbdjango
Still part of Money Monday is my homework on Django school. Why? Because in the long run, I will be doing django to fuel my income. I shall get my bread and butter with a dash of sugar too from Python/Django after I finish this class.

So, I better do good at this. Keep it simple. Take down notes. Read up on django stuff.

I finished the slides already. Will continue work tomorrow 28 July 2015.

# Blog
I also want to post some of my learnings at my tech blog. A first hand experience of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). Which I ultimately failed at. In general I am excited at this new found jekyll thing. As almost excited when I discovered Ghost.

Doing this right now.

# Re$ume & LinkedIn
This I have to update. I want to apply again to dev roles but this time python and django. I have to add Python/Django to my skills training provided by Common Code. This is the latest update to add to my repertoire.

I shall start applying once again. I need More Money Mondays to come. Everything is doing great! Keep it up andoy. You're almost there!

I haven't progressed on this today. Tomorrow is a new day. Find a SINGLE job ad online. Draft a resume for that job.
