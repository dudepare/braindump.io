I went to the career expo in the city. Lots of people. The ones that were on the exhibition are uni's and tafe organizations. One thing that stood out to me was the Air Traffic Controller career path.

# [Air Services Australia](http://www.airservicesaustralia.com/careers/)

Is a very interesting option because I am qualified for the program. I can do the job. There is free training involved. They also pay me to study there. When I finish the training program--I will have a guaranteed job and a hefty salary. I get to work with people in the airport too! I love travel and I think it would get me closer to do more travel when I am in the job.

# Casserola @ ALDI

We have a new casserola from ALDI. This will replace our very dangerous cheap wok also from ALDI. This is an investment and will last as very long. It is safer to fry things there. It is heavier and will cook food evenly. It will not rust like the el cheapo wok it replaced. I am looking forward to working with you my dear crofton.

# Jekyll-now

I am very pleased with the theme I forked on github. I was able to get it up and running quickly. I made a few customizations to make the theme more personal. Now I am using it. I love it that it is more visually appealing than the first one. Thank you for this theme. Now, I am liking github.

# [Skillet Fried Chicken](/assets/skilletfriedchicken.pdf)
Finally, I prepared my skillet fried chicken tonight. I hope it all turns out Ok. Tomorrow is the final judging. I think 50% of the recipe is done. When I start cooking the bird--that's the other half. I hope my family would like it.
