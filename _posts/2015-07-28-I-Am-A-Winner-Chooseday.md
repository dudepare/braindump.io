Quick run through of the day yesterday. 

# Todos
1. Morning bath and pushups. I think I can go back to my third week. @ Toilet&Bedroom -- done
2. Clothes Dryer. After I drop off Erin to school--I could go straight ahead to the laundromat. This means I have finished my yoghurt and fruit breakfast already. @ Seabrook -- done
3. Update my resume based on a job ad I found. Go online and look for ONE job ad I'd like to apply to. @ Computer or Phone.
4. Worked on my homework. @ Computer -- done

# Morning Schedule
The day started out hectic because we all had to go in the car with minimal breakfast. We had to rush to Erin's school and then to Dude's work. Good thing it was not traffic in Point Cook road. We arrived five minutes early. 

We took Dunnings road from Erin's school. It turned out to be the right choice.

# Lara
I decided that Lara would not be watching too much TV. I think TV or playing with video goes to the top of her priority. That is why she forgets to listen to her body then her body lets go some wiwi. 

# Afternoon
We were all here except ate of course. We ate happily. A few minutes later it was time to fetch Erin. I let Erin play on the playground. When we get back--a much needed siesta.

# DFC
I cooked Dad's Fried Chicken today. It was a success! There's more left in the freezer and the dry fridge aka the microwave.
