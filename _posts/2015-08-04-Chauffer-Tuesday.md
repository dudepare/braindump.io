Today I spent most of my day driving around town with my family. All is good.

I always write about the things that happend today and what will I do tomorrow. That's usually it. My thinking spans two days in a regular basis but during weekends it can span upto a whole week. I want to challenge myself and think about a month or longer.

It is imperative to plan. Plan ahead--visualise what I want to achieve after this month, within the quarter, and the next year.

# Tomorrow
I answered the email that went astray to my inbox. I shall apply to the web developer position then, wait for something good to come out of it.

# This week
I want to complete my 4th homework in MelbDjango class. Then I started diving into a Mozilla project: DXR. I already have a working dev environment. All I have to do is jump in and ask for a bug to fix.

1. Started a bug to fix for Mozilla.
2. Finished my homework for MelbDjango class.
3. Greeted daddy happy happy birthday.

# This month
By the end of this month I get to see for the first time my #watchfam here in Melbourne. I shall go to the Seiko GTG. I shall bring my two seiko dive watches. It will be exciting. I do not plan to spend a fortune.

My MelbDjango class is done by then. The first week of September will be the demo. I am looking forward to apply all the things I learned and show what I can do with Django. I am not setting any expectations. I'm just in it to learn and do the best I can.

Started seriously applying for web development roles using Django/Python. I have the codebase to show.

# This Season
The end of winter the start of spring. In spring, I have a job already using python/django. Thank you Brenton and everyone at Common code that made this possible. Now I have a new career to work on and grow. I'll never stop learning from now on. I'll learn Javascript, HTML, CSS, front end, UI UX. Everything that will come my way. Even ruby on rails!

# This Year
We are starting to grow deep roots here in Melbourne. We both have jobs. Kids have their school to go to. Everyone will be busy. That does not mean we have less time for eachother. It just means this is the start of something big.
