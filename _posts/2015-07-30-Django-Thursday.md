Today is my Django class @ Common Code once again.

# MelbDjango
I won't be late because it is important to me. This time--I should try talking to another human being in class. When I get home, I do the review of the slides immediately. The following day would be the homework. That way, the knowledge will be fresh.

I am happy I learned my lesson for this second homework. I kept it simple and they noticed. My effort paid off. I kept reading about Migrations in Django I have a hint that I should use Data Migrations bit of the document. How? I don't have an idea. I can't see in code how do the migrations delete data from the database. I am eager to know how to do this right.

Use spaces instead of tabs.
pep-8. [Style guide for python.](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/)

How do you access the captured stuff in the urls.py regular expression?

I'm sure this presenter is a brilliant coder, but he's not the best teacher or presenter for this lesson.

Five minutes of fame. My code got featured in the slide.

He had an air of competence.

Bonus points this week. Create a summary page.
Clients Summary.

# Open Source Projects
Am I ready to contribute and wet my feet in open source development. I think I should jump right in. There's no perfect time but now. 

# Jobs
I am getting ready to go back to actively look for a job. I am studying. I am updating my skills. I should update my resume and linked in next. Just 30 mins a day would do the trick.
